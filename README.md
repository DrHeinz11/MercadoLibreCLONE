## About The App

[FreeMarket] The purpose of this application is to put into practice my knowledge in React.Js and perfecting my layout using CSS from the facility proposed by ChakraUI because you can use CSS directly from the React components, in this case I took the UI design of a very famous ecommerce in Latin America (MercadoLibre) which I adapted it using different box shadows and provisions in the layout, modifying the Logo because it is not allowed by the hostings. 
- This layout is oriented to full responsive, it started from a desktop view and from the use of Flexbox and Grid it was oriented to mobile views.

## Technologies

I used `HTML`, `CSS`,`React.Js`,`ChakraUI`,`React-Router-Dom`, `Chakra-Icons`,`Context` ...

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- Install dependencies `yarn install`
- Run aplication `yarn run dev`
- Build aplication `yarn build`
- Build Preview aplication `yarn preview`

## Approach

I used the react js framework to create each of the functional components for the app, the styling was applied using the ChakraUi style library, I used both react Context Api to control the data and interactions of the functionalities.
Since chakra has a deficit with the elements , use a .css stylesheet to make up for that deficit and get to the proposed design,used chakraUI as a `CSS` library in `JavaScript`. 
I used Adobe Illustrator and AdobeXd to create the SVGs needed for the categories. 
## Status

[FreeMarket] is still in progress. `Version 2.4.2` will be out soon.
